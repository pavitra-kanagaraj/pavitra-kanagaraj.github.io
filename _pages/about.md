I am a graduate student in macroeconomics at the Barcelona School of Economics. Previously, I worked as a data journalist at Hindustan Times in Delhi, India. I authored over 50 data explainers on various themes such as economy, gender, crime and politics. 

Besides, I have conducted research for organisations including UNESCAP (Macroeconomic Policy and Financing for Development) and the Centre for Civil Society (Delhi, India). I hold a MA in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and BA(H) in Economics from University of Delhi. 

I'm passionate about using data-informed approaches to help clients understand the macreconomic developments and policy landscape in India and G20 economics. I'm open to collaborations - reach out to me!
